# Sauced

**Sauced** is an add-on for [Burgered](https://github.com/wired-tomato/burgered),
a mod which adds buildable burgers to the game.

Sauced allows you to cook Potions down into sauces which you can put onto these
burgers, and nothing else.

## How

You can brew a Potion with an Egg to make Sauce!
These sauces contain all the original potion effects that they had as potions,
except they can be applied to burgers and eaten.
Delicious!
